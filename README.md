# Hangman-Game
This Python **Hangman** game selects a random programming language name for the player to guess. It tracks guessed letters, displays progress with underscores, and updates a **hangman ASCII drawing** for each wrong guess. The game continues until the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
